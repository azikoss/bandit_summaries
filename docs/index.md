## Bandit Algorithm Summaries
I started to read [Bandit Algorithm](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf) to expand my knowledge in this domain. I decided to write down my per-chapter summaries from the book and implement the introduced algorithms to better consume the knowledge. This is what I included in this repo. I write down these summaries for my own purposes but I would only trilled if they can help to learn something from the Multi-Armed Bandit world. In any case, if you are series about the topic, you shoul definitely read up the book. These summaries are written in more simple langauge than the book is.

Add
- visualization for intuition
- not referencing properly from teh book. 
- the summaries are not a replacement for thourouw reading of the book
